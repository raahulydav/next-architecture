Points to consider for architecture plans

Imports Convention
* imports should be in sequence (this is what I find to be reader frienly. Open to discuss more on this)
  * 'next' imports
  * third party libs imports
  * local imports
  * assets imports
  * css imports

TODO:
* Error pages
* API Calls
* Assets & css 
* Utils
* Documentation convention
* State management
* Localization
* Private & public routes
* TS
