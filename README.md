Points to consider for architecture plans

* imports should be in sequence (this is what I find to be reader frienly. Open to discuss more on this)
  * 'next' imports
  * third party libs imports
  * local imports
  * assets imports
  * css imports

TODO:
* Error pages
* API Routes
* Assets & css 
* Utils
* Documentation style
